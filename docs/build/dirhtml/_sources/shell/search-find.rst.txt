Searching and finding
=====================

Questions to think about:
-------------------------

How can we find files? How can we find things in files?

Commands of the Day
-------------------

-  ``grep`` is a contraction of global/regular expression/print. It
   finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.

   -  **regular expressions** are patterns that can include wildcards
   -  Usage: ``grep pattern filename``
   -  ``grep -w`` limits to word boundaries
   -  ``grep -n`` prints the line numbers that match
   -  ``grep -i`` makes search case-insensitive
   -  ``grep -v`` inverts the search to output that does not contain the
      pattern
   -  ``grep -E`` notes that the pattern is an extended regular
      expression that can contain wildcards

-  ``find`` command finds files!

   -  ``-type`` d or f for directories or files
   -  ``-name`` matches a name, but look out for order of execution!
      Filenames with wildcards need quotes. For example,
      ``find . -name "*.txt"``

-  ``$()`` to combine commands. Code inside this runs first!

   -  For example, ``wc -l $(find . -name "*.txt")``
