Going over the fundmentals, we learned how to store numbers and sets of
characters as variables. Python also has built-in ways to store multiple
strings and numbers, namely **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and
**sets**. These all allow you to groups of ints, floats, and strings in
different arrangements. Here, we created a ``list`` of 5 ints called
``x``.

.. tab:: Python


   .. code:: python

      x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] # integers 1 - 5

Here are brief descriptions of the four structures.

-  Lists: store data in a **specific order**
-  Dictionaries: store combinations of **keys** and **values** without
   any order
-  Tuples: store data in a specific order and **cannot** be altered
-  Sets: store unordered data

We will dive into these in more detail below, focusing primarily on
lists and dictionaries.

Lists
-----

Lists are very common tools in Python. They allow us to store large
amounts of data with an order. They come with very handy tools to
reference different objects stored in them. We can also easily add items
to them.

Initialize a list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways of initializing an empty list: ``list()`` and ``[]``.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      # these do the same thing
      my_list = list() 
      your_list = []

To make a list with pre-populated with items, we can fill the brackets
with comma-separated values.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      number_list = [ 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 ] # lists can hold numbers
      string_list = [ 'cat', 'dog', 'rabbit' ] # can also hold strings

Referencing to items in a list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each item in a list has an **index**. If your list has 3 items, it has 3
indexes (or indicies, depending on who you ask).

In Python, indexes starts at 0. To reference the first item in
``number_list``, we use ``number_list[0]``.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      number_list[0] # get the first item from number_list

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      0.1

We can reference the rest of the numbers in the list with indexes 1
through 3. Note that even though there are 4 items in the list, the
index goes from 0 to 3.

We also can use the items in a list the same way we can use variables to
do math or other operations.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      print( number_list[1] - number_list[3] ) # 0.2 - 0.4 
      print( 'my favorite kind of animal is', string_list[2] ) # prints rabbit

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      -0.2
      my favorite kind of animal is rabbit

If we try to reference an index that does not exist in a list, we get an
error.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      number_list[4]

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      IndexError: list index out of range

If we want to reference the last item in a list, we can do it two ways.
We can use the length of list and subtract 1. Alternatively, we can also
use ``[-1]`` as a shorthand for the last item.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      print( number_list[ len(number_list) - 1 ] )
      print( number_list[-1])

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      0.4
      0.4

Appending to a list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we want to add an item to the end of ``string_list``, we can use
``string_list.append()``.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      string_list.append('bear')
      print(string_list)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit', 'bear']

Reassigning an item in a list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can also alter any item currently in a list.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      number_list[0] = 2096
      print(number_list)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      [2096, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

Question 1: Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a list of numbers. Add the first number in the list to the last
number of the list. Append this value to the list.

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      .. tab:: Python

         .. code:: python

            num_list = [25, 50, 75, 100]
            num_list.append( num_list[0] + num_list[-1] )



Dictionaries
------------

Like lists, dictionaries are powerful ways to store items. However, the
two structures are quite different from each other. Instead of storing
items in a specific order, like a list, dictionaries store them as
**keys** and **values**. 

For example, you might have a key ``giraffes``
paired with the value ``25``, and the key ``kangaroos`` paired with the
value ``32``. We can do this with using brackets (``{ }``) and colons
(``:``) with the format of ``{ KEY1: VALUE1, KEY2: VALUE2, ... }``.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      animals_dict = { 'giraffes': 25, 'kangaroos': 32 }

Notice that our keys are strings and our values here are ints. Keys and
values can be any data types, though it tends to be best practice for
keys to be strings.

We can also write this vertically, putting key-value pairs on their own
lines for visual clarity. You will still need to separate entries with a
comma, however.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      animals_dict = { 
         'giraffes': 25, 
         'kangaroos': 32 
      }

Once we create a dictionary with keys and values, we can use the key to
return the corresponding value. We do this by using ``DICT[KEY]``:

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      animals_dict['giraffes']

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      25

Similarly to lists, if we try to reference a key that is not present in
the dictionary, we will get an error.

.. tab:: Python
   
   .. code:: python

      animals_dict['beaver']

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      KeyError: 'beaver'

However, dictionaries have a way around this. We can use the ``.get()``
function to either return a value for a key or a default value that we
specify. We run it with ``DICT.get(KEY, DEFAULT_VALUE)``.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      animals_dict.get('beaver', 0) # will return 0 because beaver is not a key in this dictionary

.. tab:: Output
   
   .. code:: none

      0

Making an empty dictionary is similar to making an empty list. We can
either use ``dict()`` or ``{}``.


.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      # these do the same thing
      my_dict = dict()
      your_dict = {}

Adding to a dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is very simple to add a new item to a dictionary. Instead of using
the colon notation, we can simply run ``DICT[KEY] = VALUE``.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      animals_dict['moose'] = 43 # new key-value pair - moose: 43
      print(animals_dict)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      {'giraffes': 25, 'kangaroos': 32, 'moose': 43}

Give a key a new value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Giving a key a new value works just like reassigning an item in a list.
Note that this means that you cannot have two identical keys in the same
dictionary.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      animals_dict['giraffes'] = 85 # key giraffes assigned the value of 85
      print(animals_dict)

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: none

      {'giraffes': 85, 'kangaroos': 32, 'moose': 43}

Question 2: Dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assign the value of ``giraffes`` in ``animal_dict`` to a new key
``rabbit`` in the same dictionary.



.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      Assigning dictionary values of different keys can be tricky. Remember
      to have write key on the right side.

      .. tab:: Python

         .. code:: python

            animal_dict['rabbit'] = animal_dict['giraffe']


Tuples
------

Tuples are a lot like lists. They are ordered collections of items that
can be referenced with number indexing. However, they are **immutable**,
meaning that once you create one, you cannot change it by adding to it
or editing items in it. They are a somewhat more efficient to use, so
they are situationally useful.

You can create a new tuple with parentheses. Note that creating an empty
tuple has little use, since it cannot be altered.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      my_tuple = ( 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 ) 

Sets
----

Sets are unordered collections of items. You can think about about them
like dictionaries that only consist of keys. Like tuples, they are more
situationally useful than lists or dictionaries. Like dictionaries, they
also use ``{}`` but they do not use colons.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      my_set = set() # the only way to initialize an empty set

      new_set = { 'lions', 'tigers', 'bears' } # without colons, NOT a dictionary

We can add items to a list using ``.add()``. However, if the item is
already present in the set, only one copy will be kept in it. Therefore,
sets keep a unique group of items.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      new_set.add('oh my') # oh my will now be a string in the set
      print(new_set)

      new_set.add('bears') # won't have two bears in the set
      print(new_set)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      {'oh my', 'tigers', 'lions', 'bears'}
      {'oh my', 'tigers', 'lions', 'bears'}

Question 3: Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each of the following examples, should you use a list, dictionary,
tuple, or set?

1. A group of employees and their IDs.
2. All 12 months in order.
3. Your favorite foods ranked.
4. All of the foods you have tried.

.. collapse:: Solution 

   .. container::

      1. Dictionary: paired information works very well in dictionaries.
      2. Tuple: Months are ordered, and you never need to change or add to
         the months of the year. (List would ok as well.)
      3. List: You want an ordering to represent the rank, and you might
         change or add to the list.
      4. Set: Order does not matter; you just need to keep all the foods in
         one place.


Bonus: Nested structures
------------------------

We can place data structures within other data structures as well. These
new structures are referred to as **nested data structures**, and they
are powerful.

We have lists containing lists, dictionaries containing dictionaries,
dictionaries containing lists, and much more.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      # list of lists
      list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
      list2 = ['d', 'e', 'f', 'f']
      list3 = ['h', 'i', 'j']
      large_list = [list1, list2, list3]
      print(large_list)
      # dictionary of dictionaries

      sample1 = {
         'co2': [10.2, 3.4, 10.1],
         'n': 4,
         'city': 'Waltham'
      }

      sample2 = {
         'co2': [4.2, 2.3, 3.5, 23],
         'a': 23,
         'city': 'Watertown'
      }

      samples = {'s1': sample1, 's2':sample2}
      samples2 = dict()

      samples = {'s1': sample1, 's2':sample2}
      print(samples)

Indexing and referencing items in these nested structures can get quite
complicated. It’s important to know the full nested structure when doing
these references.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      print(large_list[0][2])

      print(samples['s1']['city'])

      print(samples['s2']['co2'][0])

Bonus Question 1: Nested structures pt. 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a list that contains an empty list, an empty dictionary, an empty
tuple, and an empty set.

Then, add any new item to the nested list and the set, and add a
key-item pair to the dictionary.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      # your code here

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      .. tab:: Python

         .. code:: python

            nested_list = [ list(), dict(), tuple(), set()]
            # or
            nested_list = [ [], {}, (), set()] # can't make an empty set the same way

            nested_list[0].append('a new item') # appending list
            nested_list[3].add('another new item')
            nested_list[1]['a new key'] = 'a new value'


Bonus Question 2: Nested structures pt. 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want to store information regarding the ecological community in the
local area.

In Rivertown, there are 12 species of frogs, 2 species of snakes, and 20
species of birds.

In Spring Valley, there are 4 species of frogs, 1 species of snake, 2
species of birds, and 13 species of rodents.

In Ice Town, there are 4 species of birds, 6 species of rodents, and 1
species of bear.

Store this information in one nested data structure.


.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      # your code here

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      .. tab:: Python

         .. code:: python

            # nested dictionary: dictionary of dictionaries
            ecosystem = {
               'Rivertown': {'frogs':12, 'snakes':2, 'birds':20},
               'Spring Valley': {'frogs':1, 'snakes': 1, 'birds': 2, 'rodents': 13},
               'Ice Town': {'birds': 4, 'rodents':6, 'bear':1}
            }
