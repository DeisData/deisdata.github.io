Install/Update R & RStudio
==========================

Before the first session
------------------------

To participate in Programming with R, please bring a laptop with R and
RStudio installed. We recommend that you have the latest version of R.

You need to have RStudio installed, but it is less crucial that you are
using the most recent version.

Do you already have R and RStudio installed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**No**: follow the instructions for “I do not have R installed”.

**Yes**: follow the instructions for “I have R installed”.

Installing R
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Windows**: 

- Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ 
- Click the “Download R X.X.X for Windows” link. The X's will be replaced with the numbers for most recent version of R. 
- When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to click “Next” to all dialogs to finish the installation.

**Mac**: 

- Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/. 
- Click the link “R-X.X.X.pkg” (again, with the X's standing in the most recent version).
- When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to click “Next” to all dialogs to finish the installation.

Installing RStudio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.
-  Under “Installers for Supported Platforms” select the appropriate
   installer for your operating system:

   -  Windows: “RSTUDIO-20xx.xx.x-xxx.EXE”
   -  Mac: “RSTUDIO-20xx.xx.x-xxx.DMG”

-  When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You
   should be able to click “Next” to all dialogs to finish the
   installation.

You are ready for Data Science Essentials for R!

Already Installed R
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workshops run more smoothly when everyone is using the same version
of R. Please update R, if necessary (and less crucially, RStudio).

Verify R version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Open RStudio.
-  At the top of the Console you will see session info. The first line
   tells you which version of R you are using.
-  If RStudio is already open and you’re deep in a session, type
   R.version.string to print out the R version.

Do you have the most recent version of R installed?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**No**: follow the instructions for “Updating R”.

**Yes**: You are ready for Data Science Essentials for R!

Updating R/RStudio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Windows**

To update R on Windows, try using the package installr (only for
Windows).

Install and load ``installr``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``install.packages(“installr”)`` and ``library(installr)``
-  Call ``updateR()`` function. This will start the updating process of your
   R installation by finding the latest R version, downloading it,
   running the installer, deleting the installation file, copy and
   updating old packages to the new R installation.
-  From within RStudio, go to **Help** > **Check for Updates** to install newer
   version of RStudio (if available, optional).

You are ready for Data Science Essentials for R!

**Mac**

On Mac, you can simply download and install the newest version of R.
When you restart RStudio, it will use the updated version of R.

-  Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
-  Click the link “R-x.x.x.pkg”
-  When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You
   should be able to click **Next** to all dialogs to finish the
   installation.
-  From within RStudio, go to **Help** > **Check for Updates** to install newer
   version of RStudio (if available, optional).
