Data
^^^^

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, William Dyer, 
Frank Pabodie, and Valentina Roerich led 
expeditions to the Pole of Inaccessibility in 
the South Pacific, and then onward to Antarctica. 
Two years ago, their expeditions were found in a 
storage locker at Miskatonic University. We have 
scanned and OCR the data they contain, and we now want 
to store that information in a way that will make search 
and analysis easy.

Download the data: `survey.db <http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/files/survey.db>`__.
