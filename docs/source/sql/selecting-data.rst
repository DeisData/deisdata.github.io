Selecting data
==============

Key Points
----------

-  A relational database stores information in tables, each of 
   which has a fixed set of columns and a variable number of records.
-  A database manager is a program that manipulates information stored 
   in a database.
-  We write queries in a specialized language called SQL to extract 
   information from databases.
-  Use ``SELECT… FROM…`` to get values from a database table.
-  SQL is case-insensitive (but data is case-sensitive).
