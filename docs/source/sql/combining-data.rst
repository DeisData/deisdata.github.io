Combining data from multiple tables
===================================

Key Points
----------

-  Use ``JOIN`` to combine data from two tables.
-  Use table.field notation to refer to fields when doing joins.
-  Every fact should be represented in a database exactly once.
-  A join produces all combinations of records from one table with 
   records from another.
-  A primary key is a field (or set of fields) whose values uniquely 
   identify the records in a table.
-  A foreign key is a field (or set of fields) in one table whose 
   values are a primary key in another table.
-  We can eliminate meaningless combinations of records by matching 
   primary keys and foreign keys between tables.
-  The most common join condition is matching keys.
