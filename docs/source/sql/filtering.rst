Filtering
=========

Key Points
----------

-  Use ``WHERE`` to specify conditions that records must 
   meet in order to be included in a query\’s results.
-  Use ``AND``, ``OR``, and ``NOT`` to combine tests.
-  Filtering is done on whole records, so conditions can 
   use fields that are not actually displayed.
-  Write queries incrementally.
-  Wildcard: A character used in pattern matching. In SQL\’s 
   like operator, the wildcard “%” matches zero or more characters, 
   so that ``%able%`` matches “fixable” and “tablets”.
