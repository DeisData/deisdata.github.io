Sorting out and removing duplicates
===================================

Key Points
----------

-  The records in a database table are not intrinsically ordered: 
   if we want to display them in some order, we must specify that 
   explicitly with ``ORDER BY``.
-  The values in a database are not guaranteed to be unique: if we 
   want to eliminate duplicates, we must specify that explicitly as 
   well using ``DISTINCT``.
