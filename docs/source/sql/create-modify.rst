Creating and Modifying Data and Tables
======================================

Key Points
----------

-  Use ``CREATE`` and ``DROP`` to create and delete tables.
-  Use ``INSERT`` to add data.
-  Use ``UPDATE`` to modify existing data.
-  Use ``DELETE`` to remove data.
-  It is simpler and safer to modify data when every record has a unique primary key.
-  Do not create dangling references by deleting records that other records refer to.
