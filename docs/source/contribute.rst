How to contribute to DeisData
=============================

Programming and data are ever-evolving fields. 
While we regularly update and maintain the information here,
we encourage suggestions of changes to update information and
fill in any knowledge gaps.

Feel free to email us with any potential changes: 
`dataservices@brandeis.edu <dataservices@brandeis.edu>`__

For any changes you would be personally willing to work on yourself, we have 
guides for submitting both :doc:`small changes <contribute/small-changes>` and :doc:`larger structural changes  <contribute/structural-changes>`. 
Make sure you have a GitHub account for making these suggestions.

This website is built using the language reStructured Text with Sphinx. 
We have a brief guide of these tools here, if you are unfamiliar.
