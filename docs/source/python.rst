===========================

Welcome to the Brandeis Library Python Programming Workshop! Whether you
are participating synchronously or asynchronously, all of the materials
we will be using are listed below for each topic.

Each lesson includes a link to a page on this site, as well as links to
filled-in and code-along Python notebooks in `Google
Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`__, an online cloud-based app
that runs Python **without any installation necessary**.

Topics
------

1.  **setup & install**
2.  **jupyter**
3.  **python fundamentals** **[\*\* code-along notebook / filled-in
    notebook \*\*]**
4.  **lists & dictionaries** **[\*\* code-along notebook / filled-in
    notebook \*\*]**
5.  **conditionals** **[\*\* code-along notebook / filled-in notebook
    \*\*]**
6.  **loops** **[\*\* code-along notebook / filled-in notebook \*\*]**
7.  **numpy** **[\*\* code-along notebook / filled-in Jupyter notebook
    \*\*]**
8.  **pandas** **[\*\* code-along notebook / filled-in Jupyter notebook
    \*\*]**
9.  **figures** **[\*\* code-along notebook / filled-in notebook \*\*]**
10. **functions** **[\*\* filled-in notebook \*\*]**

Using Colab
-----------

We will be using `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`__
to run our code. No Python installation will be required for this
workshop; you just need to be signed into a Google account.

**Saving notebooks to your drive**

Once the notebook is open in Colab, click on **File** in the upper left.
If you cannot see **File**, try clicking the down arrow in the top
right. Click **Save a copy in Drive**. You can rename the file, and the
copy will be located in a new folder in your Google Drive called **Colab
Notebooks**. You can now freely save changes to your personal version of
the file.

If you would prefer not to use Colab, click on **File** and then
**Download > Download .ipynb**. You will need `Anaconda or Miniconda
installed </python/setup-install/>`__. You can use a variety of
different programs to interact with the notebook, such as
`Spyder <https://www.spyder-ide.org/>`__, `VS
Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__,
`PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__, and more.
