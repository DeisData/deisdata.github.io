How to contribute small changes
===============================

GitHub forking and pull requests
================================

To suggest a specific small change to a page, the easiest 
method is to create a pull request that includes the change.

1.  Go to the `websiteâ€™s GitHub repository <https://github.com/DeisData/deisdata.github.io>`__.
2.  Make sure you are in `the master branch <https://github.com/DeisData/deisdata.github.io/tree/master>`__.
3.  :doc:`Fork </git/forking>` the repository.
4.  In your fork, commit your change. You can do this by 
    directly editing a page, or by :doc:`creating a local clone </git/quick-start>`
    and :doc:`pushing your commits </git/pushing>` to the fork. 
5.  Create a new :ref:`pull request <pull request>`. The maintainers of the repository 
    will review your pull request. 


Creating a new issue
====================

You can also `create new issues on the GitHub repository <https://github.com/DeisData/deisdata.github.io/issues>`__ 
to suggest changes, as well. In your issue, please be 
specific about where you would like to see a change. If 
one of our maintainers has bandwidth, we can evaluate 
the issue and potentially make a change. Otherwise, we 
may ask you to potentially make a pull request with the 
change.
