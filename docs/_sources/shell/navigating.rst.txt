Navigating to files and directories
===================================

Your challenges of the day:
---------------------------

1. Does type case matter? Is there a difference between ``ls -s`` and
   ``ls -S``?
2. Do spaces matter? Is there a difference between ``ls-F`` and
   ``ls -F``?

Questions to think about:
-------------------------

-  What is a command shell and why should I use one?
-  How can I move around on my computer?
-  How can I see what files and directories I have?
-  How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?

What is Unix Shell?
-------------------

We usually interact with our devices on a **graphical user interface**
(GUI). Shell is a **Command-Line Interface** (CLI), where we type
commands in the **prompt** ``$`` instead of pointing and clicking. We
use it to invoke complicated programs. Shell is a scripting language,
and we will use the Unix Shell: Bash (Bourne Again SHell by Stephen
Bourne).

Why use Bash?
-------------

Bash combines existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large
volumes of data automatically. We can write sequences of commands into a
script, improving the reproducibility of workflows. It is essential to
interface with hardware, HPCC, and remote machines.

Navigating files and directories
--------------------------------

The **file system** is the part of the operating system responsible for
managing files and directories. 

- **Files** hold information. 
- **Directories** (or **folders**) hold files or other directories. Think
  of them like *places*. 
- The **current working directory** is the place
  where you are in the file system when you are using the shell. 
- The **root directory** is the top directory that holds everything else. It
  is referred to by a slash ``/`` on its own. This is the leading slash in
  other directory paths, for example ``/home/fordfishman/`` 
- **Hidden files and directories** start with ``.`` like ``.bash_profile``. They
  are usually configuration settings and are hidden to prevent cluttering
  the terminal with a standard ``ls`` command. Add the ``-a`` option see
  hidden files.

Example of directory structure:

.. code:: none

   Documents
   ├── Code
   │   ├── analysis.py
   │   └── functions.py
   ├── Data
   │   └── info.csv
   ├── description.txt
   └── .gitignore

Paths
-----

The path to a file displays the directories that file is a member of.
For instance, if you have a file called ``data.txt`` on your Desktop,
its path could be ``/home/fordfishman/Desktop/data.txt``. This is an
**absolute path** because it begins at the root directory. We also use
**relative paths** that change based on our current working directory.
If the working directory is ``/home/fordfishman``, the relative path to
the file is ``Desktop/data.txt``.

General syntax of a shell command
---------------------------------

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ ls -F /

``ls`` is the **command**, with an **option** (or **switch** or
**flag**) ``-F`` and an **argument** ``/``. **Options** start with a
single dash (``-``) or two dashes (``--``) and change the behavior of
the command. Arguments tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files
and directories). Options and argements are refered to as
**parameters**.

.. note:: 
   
   Type case is important. Spaces are important between command and
   options. (But options can be combined with a single ``-`` and no spaces -> ``-aF``).

Listing: ``ls``
---------------

We use the ``ls`` command to list the contents of the current directory.

It has many options we can provide: 

- ``-F`` option (switch or flag) tells ls to classify the output by adding a marker to file and directory
  names to indicate what they are. 
- ``-a`` option displays all files, including hidden files (files starting with ``.``) 
- ``-s`` option displays the size of files and directories 
- ``-S`` option will sort the files and directories by size 
- ``--help`` option will tell us how to use the command and what options it accepts

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ ls -F

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      Applications/   data_shell/      Music/
      Desktop/        data_shell.zip   Pictures/
      Documents/      Library/
      Downloads/      Movies/

Explore more ``ls`` flags.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. What does ``-l`` option do? What if you use ``-l`` and ``-h``? 
2. The default ``ls`` lists contents in alphabetical order. What option
   do I use to see them by time of last change?

Print working directory: ``pwd``
--------------------------------

To check where you are, use ``pwd`` to print the path of the **working
directory**.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      /home/fordfishman/

Change directory: ``cd``
------------------------

``cd`` will change your working directory. ``cd`` can only see
sub-directories inside your current working directory. 

- ``cd ..`` is a shortcut to move up one directory to the *parent directory* of the one
  we are in 
- ``cd ~/`` is a shortcut to move to the current user’s home
  directory. For example, if my home directory is ``/home/fordfishman``,
  then ``~/data`` is equivalent to ``/home/fordfishman/data``

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ cd ..
      $ pwd

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      /home/

Other commands
--------------

-  ``clear``: clears the terminal if it gets to cluttered
-  up and down arrows can be used to access previous commands (or
   scroll)
-  ``man`` will give you the manual for a command, for example
   ``man ls`` will tell us all about listing
-  The help option can be used with a command, for example ``ls --help``
