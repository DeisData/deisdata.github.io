Altering files and directories
==============================

Questions to think about:
-------------------------

-  How can I create, copy, and delete files and directories?
-  How can I edit files?

Creating Directories or Files
-----------------------------

``mkdir`` creates a new directory, followed by the name of the new
directory.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ mkdir new_dir
      $ ls -F

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      new_dir/

``mkdir -p`` can be used to make subdirectories.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ mkdir -p code/python/analysis
      $ ls -RF # displays subdirectory structure

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      code/

      ./code:
      python/

      ./code/python:
      analysis/

      ./code/python/analysis:

``nano filename.txt`` runs a text editor called ``nano`` to create a new
file by the name given. For example, ``nano thesis.txt`` creates a text
file named ``thesis.txt`` in the working directory.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ nano filename.txt

.. figure:: /_static/images/shell/alter-dir/nano.png
   :alt: nano

``touch filename.txt`` creates an empty (0 byte) file by the new name
given. Why bother? Some programs require empty files to populate with
output.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ touch filename2.txt
      $ ls -F

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      filename.txt
      filename2.txt

Moving or renaming directories or files safely
----------------------------------------------

``mv filename.txt new_location`` command move has two arguments. The
first tells ``mv`` what we’re moving, while the second is where it will
go.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ mv filename.txt new_dir
      $ ls -F new_dir

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      filename.txt

``mv -i`` or ``mv -interactive`` must be used to make ``mv`` ask for
confirmation before overwriting any existing file or directory with the
same name as the second argument. (Otherwise, beware! It will silently
overwrite.)

Copying directories and/or files
--------------------------------

``cp old new`` command copies a file (first argument) to a new location
(second argument)

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ cp filename2.txt new_dir
      $ ls -F

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      filename2.txt
      new_dir/

-  ``cp -r`` adds the recursive option to copy a directory and all its
   contents to another directory (second argument). For example, we can
   make a backup with ``cp -r thesis thesis_backup``.
-  ``cp`` can be used on multiple filenames as long as a destination
   directory is the last argument. For example,
   ``cp a.txt b.txt c.txt backup/`` will copy the three text files into
   the subdirectory ``backup/``.

Removing files and directories safely: **Deleting is forever**
--------------------------------------------------------------

``rm`` is used to remove items from a directory. Using it without any
options, however, can be dangerous, as deleted items do not go to a
trash or recycling bin.

-  ``rm -i path`` command for remove with interactive option to ask for
   confirmation before deleting.
-  ``rm -i -r path`` command with interactive option and recursive
   option will **remove a directory and all its contents** with
   confirmation prompts.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ rm -i -r new_dir
      $ ls

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none


      filename2.txt

Tips for good names for files and directories
---------------------------------------------

1. Don’t use spaces. Use ``-`` or ``_`` or *camelCase*.
2. Don’t begin a name with a ``-`` (dash). It will look like a command
   option. Names should start with letters or numbers.
3. Avoid special characters. Some have special meanings.

.. note::
   
   If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces,
   put them in quotes (““).

What’s in a name?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **filename extension** is the second part of the filename after the
dot (``.``). They help us and programs tell different kinds of files
apart. A few examples: 

- .txt: plain text file 
- .csv: comma separated value file 
- .pdf: PDF document 
- .cfg: configuration file of parameters
  for a program 
- .png: an image file

The **wildcard** ``*`` matches zero or more characters. For example, to
copy all text files in a directory, use ``cp *.txt DIR_NAME``.

The **wildcard** ``?`` matches exactly one character.

Which editor should I use?
--------------------------

``nano`` is a built-in text editor that only works with plain character
data (i.e. no tables, images, or other media). It is the least complex,
but you may want to try more powerful editors.

**For Unix Systems (Linux and macOS)** 

- `Emacs <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs>`__ 
- `Vim <http://vim.org/>`__ 
- `Gedit <http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/>`__ is a graphical editor

**For Windows** 

- `Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`__ 
- ``notepad`` is built-in and can be run in the command line

.. admonition:: Editor tips

   If you start an editor from the shell, it will use your current working
   directory as its default location.

   In editor commands, the Control key is also called :kbd:`Ctrl` or :kbd:`^`.

Challenge Questions
-------------------

**(1) Moving files.** We accidentally put the files ``sucrose.dat`` and
``maltose.dat`` into the wrong folder, ``analyzed/``. Fill in the blanks
to move these files into the ``raw/`` folder.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ ls -F
      analyzed/  raw/
      $ ls -F analyzed/
      fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat
      $ cd analyzed

My next line of code should be (fill in the blanks):

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ mv sucrose.dat matose.dat ___/___


.. collapse:: Solution 

   .. container::

      Think about ``../raw`` Recall that ``..`` refers to the parent
      directory (i.e. one above the current directory).


**(2) Renaming Files.** We mispelled a filename! Which of the following
commands will correct our mistake?


a. ``cp statstics.txt statistics.txt``
b. ``mv statstics.txt statistics.txt``
c. ``lmv statistics.txt .``
d. ``cp statstics.txt .``

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      a. Will copy the file, so we will end up with the mispelled and correct version.
      b. Will move (i.e. rename) the incorrect file name to a correct filename.
      c. Not a working command.
      d. Will not work. Remember ``.`` is the current directory.

**(3) Removal.** What happens when we execute
``rm -i thesis/finaldraft.txt``? Why would we want this protection when
using ``rm``?

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      The program will confirm that we want to delete the thesis final
      draft file. Remember, deletion is forever! There is no trash can or
      recycle bin.

**(4) Removal.** What is wrong with the command ``rm -i thesis``?

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      The remove command will not act on a directory unless the recursive
      option ``-r`` is given.


**(5) Removal.** What is wrong with the command ``rm -r thesis``?

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      This remove command will successfully delete the directory thesis and
      all its contents, but we forgot to check for confirmation with the
      interaction option (-i). Remember, deletion is permanent!

**(6) Wildcards.** Which of the following matches the file names
``ethane.dat`` and ``methane.dat``?

a. ``ls ?ethane.dat``
b. ``ls *ethane.dat``
c. ``ls ???ane.dat``
d. ``ls ethane.*``

.. collapse:: Hint

   .. container::

      Remember the ``?`` wildcard matches to exactly one character. The ``*``
      wildcard can match to zero to many characters.

.. collapse:: Solution


   .. container::

      a. Matches ``methane.dat`` only (needs one character before ``ethane.dat``).
      b. Matches both, can have any number of characters (including zero) before ``ethane.dat``.
      c. Matches ``ethane.dat`` only (requires only 3 characters before ``ane.dat``).
      d. Matches ``ethane.dat`` only (requires no characters before ``ethane``).

Challenge Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before heading on a trip, you want to back up your data and send some
datasets to Ford. Fill in the following commands to get the job done.
First, let’s set up a directory and files.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      # Hashtag denotes a comment. The line will be skipped

      # Change to your desktop 
      cd ~/Desktop

      # Make a new folder for our fake data
      mkdir fake_data
      cd fake_data

      # Create some empty files.
      touch 2020-06-09-data.txt
      touch 2020-06-09-calibration.txt

      # Make sure the new files are created. Notice we can combine options)
      ls -Fs

      # Let's add some info to our file and confirm it with the editor (spoiler alert - redirects!)
      echo Hello World > 2020-06-09-data.txt
      nano 2020-06-09-data.txt

      # Let's edit and add information to another.
      nano 2020-06-09-calibration.txt

The next piece is provided in the shell script ``session2challenge.sh``.

While in your ``fake_data`` directory, copy and paste the code from this
file and run it.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      # session2challenge.sh creates more fake data and callibration files

      fmonth="2020-06"
      echo $fmonth

      # Loop through days to create data files and calibration files
      for i in `seq -w 10 30`
      do
         # Define the filename
         printf -v fname '%s-%02d-data.txt' "$fmonth" "$i"
         # Create an empty file
         touch "$fname"
         # Redirect in some data
         echo data $i > "$fname"
         
         printf -v fname '%s-%02d-calibration.txt' "$fmonth" "$i"
         touch "$fname"
         echo $i > "$fname"
      done

Now, it’s your turn! 

1. Create a backup directory with separate
   subdirectories for data and calibration files. Copy files to the
   appropriate locations. 
2. Create a directory named send_to_ford and copy all the data from June 11th to it.

.. collapse:: Hint

   .. container::

      Create a backup directory with subdirectories for data and calibration files

      -  Hint: You will use ``mkdir``

      .. tab:: Bash

         .. code:: bash

            mkdir ___
            mkdir ___/___
            mkdir ___/___

      Copy data files to ``backup/data``. (Use a similiar approach for calibration files.) 

      -  Hint: Use the copy command ``cp`` with wildcards

      .. tab:: Bash

         .. code:: bash

            cp *-data.txt backup/___

      Copy June 11th files to ``send_to_ford/``.

      -  Hint: Use the copy command ``cp`` with wildcards!

      .. tab:: Bash

         .. code:: bash

            cp *-11-*.txt send_to_ford/
