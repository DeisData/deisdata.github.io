Often, programs need to do the same task several times repeatedly. You
may need to run a task just a handful of times, or maybe thousands of
times.

For example, say you want to print out all of the numbers 0 - 5. You
could write ``print()`` 5 times:

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      print(0)
      print(1)
      print(2)
      print(3)
      print(4)
      print(5)

However, if you want to expand this even a few numbers further, it gets
very tedious very quickly.

To save us from having to have the same code duplicated over and over,
we have **loops**. They are incredibly powerful tools for examining
large amounts of information. Here we will be looking at :code:`while`
loops and :code:`for` loops.

``while`` loops
---------------

``while`` loops are somewhat similar to ``if`` statements as both depend
on conditions to do actions. You can think of a ``while`` loop as an
``if`` statement that keeps on repeating as long as the condition stays
true.

Here is an example of a basic ``while`` loop:

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      i = 0 # initialize index

      while i < 5: # runs 5 times
         
         print(i)
         i += 1 # increment i

.. tab:: Output   

   .. code:: none

      0
      1
      2
      3
      4

Let’s break down the code. 

- ``i = 0``: We initialize ``i`` as 0 before
  the ``while`` loop 
- ``while i < 5:``: This begins the ``while`` loop
  and specifies the condition being tested. Essentially it means as long
  as ``i`` is less than 5, keep doing the code below. 
- ``print(i)``: Print current value of ``i`` 
- ``i += 1``: We increase the value of ``i`` at the end of each loop 
- Once ``i += 1`` runs, the ``while`` loop
  checks the current value of ``i`` 
- If ``i`` is less than 5, the code in
  the ``while`` loop runs again. Otherwise, the loop is over.

We have to be careful not to create an infinite loop. For instance, if
you removed the line with ``i += 1``, ``i`` would never reach 5, and the
loop would keep printing ``0``. If you do this, you can always halt
execution of the cell.

Below is more complicated ``while`` loop. We have a list of names, and
an index ``i`` keeping track of where we are in the list. We want to
print out names until we reach ``'Jimmy'``, so we keep a boolean
variable called ``notJimmy`` set to ``True`` initially. We go through
the list one name at a time and check to see if the name is ``'Jimmy'``.
If the name is ``'Jimmy'``, we change ``notJimmy`` to be ``False``;
otherwise, we don’t do anything. Regardless, we continue to the end of
the loop, printing the name and the value of ``notJimmy`` and
incrementing ``i`` by one. If ``not Jimmy`` is true, the loop keeps
going; otherwise, it is finished.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      friends = ['Jim', 'Bob', 'Jimbob', 'Jimmy', 'James'] # list of friend names

      notJimmy = True # initialize condition as True
      i = 0 # initialize index i as 0

      while notJimmy: # while notJimmy is True
         
         friend = friends[i] # select one of the friend names
         
         if friend == 'Jimmy': # if the friend name is Jimmy
            notJimmy = False # change notJimmy to be false
            
         print(friend, ',', notJimmy) # print each name and also the val of not Jimmy
         i += 1 # increment i

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      Jim , True
      Bob , True
      Jimbob , True
      Jimmy , False

Question 1: ``while`` loops:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a variable ``x`` with the value of 8. Divide ``x`` by 2 and
re-assign this value to ``x``. Continue to do this until ``x`` is less
than 0.00001. Print out how many divisions this takes.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      ### your code here:


.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      .. tab:: Python

         .. code:: python

            x = 8
            i += 1

            while x >= 0.00001:

               x /= 2
               i += 1

            print(i)
      
      .. tab:: Output

         .. code:: none

            20

``for`` loops
-------------

``for`` loops are one of the most powerful tools that base Python has to
offer. ``for`` loops take **iterables** (lists, dictionaries, sets,
tuples, even strings) and perform the same actions to each item
contained within them.

In the code below, each number in a list gets added to 20, and then the
sum is printed. We call this **iterating** over the items in the list.
Note the keywords ``for`` and ``in``.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      num_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # list of numbers

      for n in num_list: # one at a time, make each of those numbers n
         
         print(n + 20) # print that number + 20

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      20
      21
      22
      23
      24
      25

Let’s break down this code: 

- ``num_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]``: Makes a
  list of integers 0-5. 
- ``for n in num_list:``: Take the first item in
  num_list and assign its value to ``n``. 
- ``print(n + 20)``: Add n and 20 and print the sum. 
- We then go back to the start of the loop, take
  the next item, assign it to ``n``, and start all over again.

For ordered iterables, like lists, tuples, and strings, ``for`` loops
iterate over these groups in order.

Just like normal variable names, the variable name we use after ``for``
is arbitrary, though short and descriptive is best.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      for triangle in num_list: # 0 is not a triangle
         
         print(triangle)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      0
      1
      2
      3
      4
      5

If you want to quickly create a range of numbers to iterate over, the
``range()`` function generates numbers from 0 to the int you provide
(but not including it).

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      for i in range(4): # includes 0, but not 4
         
         print(i)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      0
      1
      2
      3

We can start to use for loops to do tasks with strings, as well.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      my_breakfast = ['eggs', 'cereal', 'oatmeal', 'toast'] 

      for food in my_breakfast: # for each string in the list of string
         
         sentence = 'I like to eat ' + food + '.'
         print(sentence)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      I like to eat eggs.
      I like to eat cereal.
      I like to eat oatmeal.
      I like to eat toast.

We can use the ``enumerate()`` function to iterate over items in a list
and get their indexes at the same time.

When use use ``enumerate()``, we need to provide two variables names
separated by a comma. The first represents the current index, and the
second is the item at that index.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      for i, food in enumerate(my_breakfast):
         print('index:', i)
         print('food:', food)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      index: 0
      food: eggs
      index: 1
      food: cereal
      index: 2
      food: oatmeal
      index: 3
      food: toast

This is a very useful approach for iterating over multiple lists of the
same length at once.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      my_lunch = ['sandwich', 'chips', 'fruit', 'juice']
      my_dinner = ['pasta', 'salad', 'bread', 'dessert']

      for i, breakfast in enumerate(my_breakfast):
         lunch = my_lunch[i]
         dinner = my_dinner[i]
         
         print("my food today:", breakfast, lunch, dinner, i)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      my food today: eggs sandwich pasta 0
      my food today: cereal chips salad 1
      my food today: oatmeal fruit bread 2
      my food today: toast juice dessert 3

Question 2: Looping with indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are four lists: ``x1``, ``x2``, ``y1``, and ``y2``.

Using a single for loop, subtract the values of x1 and x2 at each index,
and take the square of the difference. Do the same for ``y1`` and
``y2``. Add the two squares together. Store all 4 squares in a list in
the same order.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      x1 = [6.3, 7.1, 3.7, 3.2, 0.1]
      x2 = [-5.7, -17.5, -3.2, -19.3,-18.2]
      y1 = [34.6, 28.4, 60.0, 68.1, 83.9]
      y2 = [188.7,  75.9, 100.1, 61.1, 180.2]

      # your code here: 

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      .. code:: python

         vals = list()

         for i, x_1 in x1:
            
            x_2 = x2[i]
            y_1 = y1[i]
            y_2 = y2[i]
            
            val = (x_1 - x_2)**2 + (y_1 - y_2)**2
            vals.append(val)

Adding in conditionals
----------------------

``for`` loops can become quite powerful when you include conditionals
that change behavior based on the item in the current iteration.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      for food in my_breakfast:
         
         if food == 'eggs': # if food is currently 'eggs'
            
            sentence = 'I do not like to eat ' + food + '.'
         
         else: # for all other values of food
         
            sentence = 'I like to eat ' + food + '.'
            
         print(sentence)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      I do not like to eat eggs.
      I like to eat cereal.
      I like to eat oatmeal.
      I like to eat toast.

We can even use full ``if``-``elif``-``else`` statements.

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      for food in my_breakfast:
         
         if len(food) < 5: # if the length of string is less than 5
            
            sentence = 'I do not like to eat ' + food + '.'
         
         elif len(food) < 6: # if the length is 5
         
            sentence = 'I sometimes like to eat ' + food + '.'
         
         else: # if the length is greater than 5
            
            sentence = 'I like to eat ' + food + '.'
            
         print(sentence)

.. tab:: Output

   .. code:: none

      I do not like to eat eggs.
      I like to eat cereal.
      I like to eat oatmeal.
      I sometimes like to eat toast.

Question 3: More loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Iterate over all integers from 0 to 1000 and print all multiples of 41
(numbers that can be divided by 41 with no remainder). How many
multiples are there?

.. tab:: Python

   .. code:: python

      ### put your code below:

.. collapse:: Solution

   .. container::

      .. tab:: Python

         .. code:: python


            i = 0 # counts the number of multiples

            for n in range(1000): 

               if n % 41 == 0: #if the remainder is 0

                  print(n)
                  i += 1

            print('number of multiples:', i)

      .. tab:: Output

         .. code:: none

            0
            41
            82
            123
            164
            205
            246
            287
            328
            369
            410
            451
            492
            533
            574
            615
            656
            697
            738
            779
            820
            861
            902
            943
            984
            number of multiples: 25

.. admonition:: Nested for loops

   Just like you can use ``if`` statements in a ``for`` loop, you can also
   put ``for`` loops inside of other ``for`` loops. This is great if you
   want to use all combinations of two lists, for instance.

   .. tab:: Python

      .. code:: python

         hats = ['bowler', 'fedora', 'beret']
         shirts = ['plaid', 'striped', 'polka dot']

         print('Outfit combinations:')

         for shirt in shirts:
            
            for hat in hats:
               
               print(shirt, "shirt with a", hat)

   .. tab:: Output

      .. code:: none

         Outfit combinations:
         plaid shirt with a bowler
         plaid shirt with a fedora
         plaid shirt with a beret
         striped shirt with a bowler
         striped shirt with a fedora
         striped shirt with a beret
         polka dot shirt with a bowler
         polka dot shirt with a fedora
         polka dot shirt with a beret

   Be careful, however. If you use very long collections of items and nest
   more than 2 loops, the runtime can become very slow.

.. admonition:: Comprehensions

   If the outcome of your ``for`` loop is to produce a list, dictionary,
   set, or tuple, and you are using minimal code in your loop, then
   **comprehensions** may be perfect for you.

   .. tab:: Python

      .. code:: python

         [ food + ' time' for food in my_breakfast ] # creates a list

   .. tab:: Output

      .. code:: none

         ['eggs time', 'cereal time', 'oatmeal time', 'toast time']

   .. tab:: Python
      :new-set:

      .. code:: python

         { food:len(food) for food in my_breakfast } # creates a dictionary

   .. tab:: Output

      .. code:: none

         {'eggs': 4, 'cereal': 6, 'oatmeal': 7, 'toast': 5}
