### How do I download a file from GitHub to my computer?
- To download a repository of materials, use the [Clone or Download] button and select "Download ZIP"
- To download an individual file, click to open the file, and right-click on the [RAW] button to "Save link as."  Make sure you retain the intended file extension -- sometimes raw files default to *.txt.
