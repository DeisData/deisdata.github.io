Pushing changes
===============

In this session, you will be making more changes to your repository, as
well as sending those changes to the remote upstream repository on
GitHub. This is known as **pushing**.

Make a new file
---------------

Let’s practice making another change and commiting it. We’ll use the
``touch`` command to make a new empty file called ``notes.txt``. Make
sure you are in the directory containing your repository first. You can
do this by running ``pwd`` (Print Working Directory) and then using
``cd`` (Change Directory) to navigate to the repository.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ touch notes.txt

Running ``ls`` will show you that ``notes.txt`` is now in your working
directory. Run ``git status`` to see that we can now stage and commit
this file.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ git add notes.txt
      $ git commit -m "Added notes files"
      $ git status

``git status`` will let us know that all changes have been committed and
that we are now 2 commits ahead of what is on GitHub.

Adding a Personal Access Token
------------------------------

GitHub now requires users to use personal access tokens in order to push
commits and perform other actions. To create a personal access token,
follow these instructions:

1. Go to GitHub.
2. Click on your profile in the top right, and go to **Settings**.
3. Scroll to the bottom and click **Developer Settings**.
4. Go to **Personal access tokens**.
5. Click **Generate new token**.
6. Write a short note for what the token is used for (e.g., “My
   MacBook”).
7. (Optional) For maximum security, give an expiration to the token.
8. Check the **repo** box. Make sure all the sub-boxes are checked, as
   well.
9. Generate token, copy the key, and make sure to store it somewhere
   securely. You will need to paste it into the terminal when we run
   ``git push``.

Pushing to GitHub
-----------------

Now that we’ve created the token, we can push our changes to GitHub.

.. tab:: Bash

   .. code:: bash

      $ git push

Once you run this command, you will prompted to enter your GitHub
username followed by the key for the token you just created. Hit Enter
after typing in your username. Paste in the key with :kbd:`Ctrl+V` or :kbd:`cmd+V`
(MacOS). Once you paste, it will not display the key in the terminal for
security purposes. Hit :kbd:`Enter` again.

.. note::

   The prompt for the key may ask for a password, but your account
   password will not work. Please use the personal access token regardless
   of the prompt’s wording.

Once the push goes through, the terminal will print some information
describing the pushing process, and your changes should now be reflected
on GitHub.
