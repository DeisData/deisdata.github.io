Machine learning
================

Welcome to our machine learning guides! Our guides are in Python, but the concepts
they describe can be applied to machine learning in other languages.

Our :doc:`Machine Learning Quick Start guide </machine-learning/quick-start>` will introduce
you to machine learning fundamentals with decision trees and random forests, two classic machine
learning algorithms.

We also have a two-part image recognition guide using tensorflow, a popular deep learning library. 
In :doc:`the first part </machine-learning/image-recognition1>`, we'll build up the rational for 
using deep learning for image recognition and describe the foundations of the model. In 
:doc:`the second part </machine-learning/image-recognition2>`, we'll improve the model incrementally 
by adding model components.
